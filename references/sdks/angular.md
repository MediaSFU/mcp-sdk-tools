This guide gives you the public setup path for the MediaSFU Angular package and points to generated API references when you need exact signatures or types.

## Quick start

- Best for: Angular apps with DI-based wrappers
- Package/artifact: `mediasfu-angular`
- Install: `npm i mediasfu-angular`

---

## Start in 60 seconds

1. Install the package: `npm i mediasfu-angular`
2. Pick backend mode: MediaSFU Cloud or self-hosted MediaSFU Open.
3. Follow the first setup section below for your framework.

### Before you continue

- Best for: Angular apps with DI-based wrappers
- New to MediaSFU? Start at [/sdks](/sdks) to compare frameworks quickly.

## Copy/paste starter

Start with install + backend config, then follow the first integration section below.

```bash
npm i mediasfu-angular
```

```ts
export const mediaSFUConfig = {
  // Cloud mode
  credentials: {
    apiUserName: process.env.MEDIASFU_API_USERNAME ?? '',
    apiKey: process.env.MEDIASFU_API_KEY ?? '',
  },
  localLink: '',
  connectMediaSFU: true,
};
```

```ts
export const mediaSFULocalConfig = {
  // Self-hosted mode
  credentials: undefined,
  localLink: 'http://localhost:3000',
  connectMediaSFU: true,
};
```

## Do not skip this order

1. Decide backend mode first: MediaSFU Cloud or self-hosted MediaSFU Open.
2. Validate one successful create or join flow with the default room surface from this SDK.
3. Only then customize the shell, cards, or room ownership model.
4. Use the generated API reference when you need exact symbols or signatures, not as the first stop.

This order prevents most early confusion and keeps backend issues separate from UI customization work.

## Choose your backend mode

| Mode | Best for | What you must provide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MediaSFU Cloud** | Fastest onboarding, managed infrastructure, less operational work | Cloud credentials stored in secure runtime or build configuration. |
| **MediaSFU Open / self-hosted** | Private infrastructure, local control, custom deployment requirements | A self-hosted MediaSFU Open deployment plus the URL or config you pass into `localLink` or the equivalent connection setting. |

If you have not made this choice yet, make it before going deeper into customization or API reference material.

## Angular UI gallery

These are live Angular SDK captures generated from the local validation host after a real room create flow succeeds and the main meeting interface is mounted. Use them to compare the Angular conference, webinar, broadcast, and chat experiences before deciding which room component to wire into your app.

The featured screenshots below are in-room captures, not static mocks. Modal shots are taken with the live room shell already active in the background. Conference and webinar now include a second real participant join so the gallery reflects a fuller meeting state. Separate prejoin capture files still exist for onboarding or entry-flow references, but they are not the main product gallery.

| Conference room | Webinar room | Broadcast room | Chat room |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Angular conference room screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-conference-room.png) | ![Angular webinar room screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-webinar-room.png) | ![Angular broadcast room screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-broadcast-room.png) | ![Angular chat room screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-chat-room.png) |

| Conference participants modal | Webinar participants modal | Broadcast share modal | Chat messages modal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Angular conference participants modal screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-conference-participants-modal.png) | ![Angular webinar participants modal screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-webinar-participants-modal.png) | ![Angular broadcast share event modal screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-broadcast-share-event-modal.png) | ![Angular chat messages modal screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-chat-messages-modal.png) |

The additional workflow captures below come from directly navigating the live Angular UI through entry, workspace, and configuration pages rather than stopping at the mounted room shell.

| Create flow | Workspace menu | Whiteboard workspace | Event settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Angular conference create flow screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-conference-create-flow.png) | ![Angular conference room menu screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-conference-room-menu.png) | ![Angular conference whiteboard workspace screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-conference-whiteboard-config.png) | ![Angular conference event settings screenshot](/img/angular-sdk/angular-conference-event-settings.png) |

Need fresh captures after UI work? Run `npm run capture:angular-sdk-screenshots` from the website folder while the Angular validation host is running.

## API reference

- Start with the portal overview at [/api-reference](/api-reference).
- Use the MediaSFU Angular entry on that page to open the staged TypeDoc site for this package at `/api/angular/`.

Use the SDK guide for workflow guidance and the staged TypeDoc site for exact package details, generated symbols, and signatures.

## Common setup mistakes

- Using Node-style `process.env` directly in runtime Angular code without build-time injection.
- Using self-hosted mode without setting `localLink`.
- Starting in full custom mode before validating the prebuilt flow.
- Backend endpoint unreachable (Cloud credentials invalid or self-hosted server offline).
- Credentials committed directly in source files instead of secure environment configuration.

If setup fails, verify install → backend mode → credentials/local link in that order.

## Troubleshooting quick checks

| Check | Symptom | Quick fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend mode mismatch | Join/create flow fails early | Confirm Cloud credentials for cloud mode, or set `localLink` for self-hosted mode. |
| Runtime env not injected | Credentials appear empty | Move secrets/env to Angular build-time config and verify values at runtime. |
| Dependency mismatch | Build/install warnings | Reinstall dependencies and avoid force-install flags unless absolutely required. |

Use this table first before diving into deeper API sections.

## Production readiness checklist

- [ ] Backend mode decided (Cloud vs self-hosted) and documented.
- [ ] Credentials/keys sourced from secure environment config (not hard-coded).
- [ ] Runtime configuration is injected via Angular-safe environment/build config.
- [ ] Happy-path join/create flow validated end-to-end.
- [ ] Release build passes cleanly in the target app environment.

Mark all items before release.

# MediaSFU Angular SDK · [mediasfu-angular on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mediasfu-angular)

**mediasfu-angular** is the Angular 17/18/19 WebRTC SDK for video conferencing, webinars, live streaming, broadcast, screen sharing, whiteboard, chat, recording, live subtitles, translation, and AI agent rooms — powered by MediaSFU Cloud or your self-hosted MediaSFU Open server. Install with `npm install mediasfu-angular`.

---

# MediaSFU Angular SDK

**Prebuilt Angular SDK for WebRTC video conferencing, webinars, livestreams, chat, screen sharing, recording, breakout rooms, whiteboards, polls, live subtitles, and translation.**

MediaSFU Angular is an Angular video conferencing SDK with prebuilt room components for meetings, webinars, livestream-style broadcasts, and chat-first rooms. It gives you production-ready room UI plus the lower-level helpers needed to move from a full prebuilt experience to a deeply customized Angular app without rewriting the media stack.

## Quick Start: First Working Room

```bash
npm install mediasfu-angular
```

```typescript
credentials = {
  apiUserName: 'your-user',
  apiKey: 'your-key',
};
```

```html
<app-mediasfu-generic
  [credentials]="credentials"
  [connectMediaSFU]="true"
></app-mediasfu-generic>
```

That is the fastest path to a working Angular video conferencing room. Once the secure create/join path works, layer in branding, overrides, or a fully custom shell.

## Pick the Right Angular Room Component

Use this table to match each Angular room component to the product shape you are building.

| Component | Best for | What users get | When to choose it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `app-mediasfu-generic` | General meetings, team calls, product defaults | Balanced room layout with the broadest starter path | Start here if you are unsure which room type fits best. |
| `app-mediasfu-webinar` | Host-led presentations, audience participation, stage-centric events | Webinar-style room flow with participant management and moderation surfaces | Choose this when one or a few presenters lead a larger audience. |
| `app-mediasfu-broadcast` | Livestream-style shows, creator dashboards, host-first production flows | Broadcast-oriented shell with invite/share and host control emphasis | Choose this when the host workflow matters more than equal participant presence. |
| `app-mediasfu-chat` | Text-first support rooms, low-bandwidth collaboration, chat-centric experiences | Message-forward room UI with the same create/join/runtime foundation | Choose this when conversation is the product and audio/video are secondary. |
| `app-mediasfu-conference` | Collaborative multi-speaker events, panels, classes, workshops | Multi-participant conference layout with richer shared-presence expectations | Choose this when many participants are expected to be visibly active. |

## Least Confusing Start Path

1. Start with `app-mediasfu-generic` and validate one successful create/join flow.
2. Decide backend mode early: MediaSFU Cloud or self-hosted MediaSFU Open.
3. Move to `app-mediasfu-webinar`, `app-mediasfu-broadcast`, or `app-mediasfu-chat` only after the base room flow is working.
4. Use `uiOverrides`, custom cards, and `customMainComponent` before going fully headless.
5. Switch to `returnUI="false"` only when you already know which MediaSFU runtime helpers your product needs.

## Common Angular Product Shapes

Use MediaSFU Angular when you need one of these product patterns:

- Angular video meeting UI with secure create/join flow.
- Angular webinar UI with host, audience, and moderation surfaces.
- Angular broadcast UI for livestream or creator-style host workflows.
- Angular chat room UI with MediaSFU room orchestration behind it.
- Angular collaboration rooms with recording, screen share, whiteboard, polls, captions, and translation in one SDK.

## Why teams use MediaSFU Angular

- **Start fast** with prebuilt room components such as `MediasfuGeneric`, `MediasfuConference`, `MediasfuWebinar`, `MediasfuBroadcast`, and `MediasfuChat`.
- **Customize progressively** with `uiOverrides`, custom cards, custom layouts, and shared room helper state.
- **Go headless when needed** by setting `returnUI="false"` and wiring MediaSFU runtime helpers into your own Angular workspace.
- **Ship collaboration features together**: voice, video, screen share, recording, whiteboard, breakout rooms, chat, polls, and translation in one SDK.

## Choose Your Path

- **Beginner**: install the package, render a prebuilt room, and connect to MediaSFU Cloud or your self-hosted server.
- **Intermediate**: override cards, modals, and layout surfaces while keeping MediaSFU's room orchestration and transports.
- **Advanced**: run the runtime headless, consume `sourceParameters`, and build a fully custom Angular UI on top of the same media/session core.

## Important: Backend Required

MediaSFU Angular is a frontend SDK. You still need a MediaSFU-compatible backend for signaling, media routing, and room lifecycle.

| Option | Best for | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MediaSFU Cloud** | Managed production deployments, faster onboarding, less infrastructure work | [MediaSFU Cloud docs](https://www.mediasfu.com/documentation#rooms) |
| **MediaSFU Open** | Self-hosting, local control, private infrastructure | [MediaSFU Open](https://github.com/MediaSFU/MediaSFUOpen) |

# Angular SDK Guide

MediaSFU Community Edition remains available if you want to self-host the backend and keep full infrastructure control. If you want managed infrastructure, use MediaSFU Cloud with the same Angular SDK surface.

## Quick Reference: Component Props & UI Overrides

> **New:** UI override coverage now extends across Webinar and Chat layouts, giving every MediaSFU interface a consistent customization path.

Every primary MediaSFU UI export—`MediasfuGeneric`, `MediasfuBroadcast`, `MediasfuConference`, `MediasfuWebinar`, and `MediasfuChat`—now ships with a consistent prop surface and a powerful `uiOverrides` input, so you can bend the bundled experience to match your product without losing MediaSFU's hardened real-time logic.

### Shared component inputs (applies to every MediaSFU UI component)

| Input | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PrejoinPage` | `ComponentType` | `WelcomePage` | Swap in a custom pre-join experience. Receives unified pre-join options so you can add branding, legal copy, or warm-up flows. |
| `localLink` | `string` | `""` | Point the SDK at your self-hosted MediaSFU server. Leave empty when using MediaSFU Cloud. |
| `connectMediaSFU` | `boolean` | `true` | Toggle automatic socket/WebRTC connections. Set to `false` when you only need the UI shell. |
| `credentials` | `{ apiUserName: string; apiKey: string }` | `{ apiUserName: "", apiKey: "" }` | Supply cloud credentials without hard-coding them elsewhere. |
| `useLocalUIMode` | `boolean` | `false` | Run the interface in local/demo mode with no remote signaling. |
| `seedData`, `useSeed` | `SeedData`, `boolean` | `{}`, `false` | Pre-populate the UI for demos, snapshot tests, or onboarding tours. |
| `imgSrc` | `string` | `https://mediasfu.com/images/logo192.png` | Default artwork used across pre-join and modal flows. |
| `sourceParameters` | `Record<string, unknown>` | `{}` | Shared helper bag (media devices, participant helpers, layout handlers). Pair with `updateSourceParameters` to mirror the SDK's internal utilities. |
| `updateSourceParameters` | `(data: Record<string, unknown>) => void` | `() => {}` | Receive the latest helper bundle so you can bridge MediaSFU logic into your own components. |
| `returnUI` | `boolean` | `true` | When `false`, mount the logic only—a perfect stepping stone to a fully bespoke interface. |
| `noUIPreJoinOptions` | `CreateMediaSFURoomOptions \| JoinMediaSFURoomOptions` | `undefined` | Feed pre-join data when `returnUI` is `false` and you want to bypass the on-screen wizard. |
| `joinMediaSFURoom`, `createMediaSFURoom` | `Function` | `undefined` | Inject your own networking layers for joining or creating rooms. |
| `canUsePersonalTranslation`, `personalTranslationUsername` | `boolean`, `string` | `false`, `undefined` | Seed translation-aware entry flows when you want personal translation defaults available at startup. |
| `customMainComponent` | `ComponentType` | `undefined` | Replace the main UI shell while retaining MediaSFU transports, sockets, and room helpers. |
| `customVideoCard`, `customAudioCard`, `customMiniCard` | `ComponentType` | `undefined` | Override participant card renders to add metadata, CTAs, or badges. |
| `[containerStyle]` | `Record<string, any>` | `undefined` | Apply inline styles to the root wrapper (dashboards, split views, etc.). |
| `[uiOverrides]` | `MediasfuUICustomOverrides` | `undefined` | Targeted component/function overrides described below. |

> **Power combo:** Set `returnUI="false"` to run MediaSFU logic headless, capture helpers via `updateSourceParameters` output, and selectively bring UI pieces back with `uiOverrides`. That gives you a gradual adoption path with minimal code churn.

```typescript
import type { MediasfuUICustomOverrides } from 'mediasfu-angular';

const overrides: MediasfuUICustomOverrides = { /* ... */ };
```

Bring the types into your project to unlock full IntelliSense for every override slot.

### Custom UI Playbook

Use a toggle-driven "playbook" component to experiment with MediaSFU's customization layers. Flip a couple of booleans and you can watch the SDK jump between prebuilt layouts, headless logic, or a fully bespoke workspace driven by `customMainComponent`.

#### What the playbook demonstrates

- **Connection presets**: toggle `connectionScenario` between `cloud`, `hybrid`, or `ce` to swap credentials, local links, and connection modes in one place.
- **Experience selector**: the `selectedExperience` switch renders `MediasfuGeneric`, `MediasfuBroadcast`, `MediasfuWebinar`, `MediasfuConference`, or `MediasfuChat` without touching the rest of your stack.
- **UI strategy flags**: booleans like `showPrebuiltUI`, `enableFullCustomUI`, and `enableNoUIPreJoin` demonstrate how to run the MediaSFU logic with or without the bundled UI.
- **Layered overrides**: toggles enable the custom video/audio/mini cards, drop-in `uiOverrides` for layout and modal surfaces, container styling, and backend proxy helpers.
- **Custom workspace demo**: a `customMainComponent` receives live MediaSFU helpers so you can build dashboards, CRM surfaces, or any bespoke host interface.
- **Debug panel & helpers**: optional JSON panel exposes the `updateSourceParameters` payload so you can see exactly what to wire into your own components.

#### Try it quickly

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-ui-playbook',
  template: `
    <ng-container [ngSwitch]="selectedExperience">
      <app-mediasfu-generic *ngSwitchCase="'generic'"
        [credentials]="currentPreset.credentials"
        [localLink]="currentPreset.localLink"
        [connectMediaSFU]="currentPreset.connectMediaSFU"
        [returnUI]="showPrebuiltUI"
        [uiOverrides]="overrides"
        [containerStyle]="containerStyle">
      </app-mediasfu-generic>
      
      <app-mediasfu-broadcast *ngSwitchCase="'broadcast'"
        [credentials]="currentPreset.credentials"
        [localLink]="currentPreset.localLink"
        [connectMediaSFU]="currentPreset.connectMediaSFU"
        [returnUI]="showPrebuiltUI"
        [uiOverrides]="overrides">
      </app-mediasfu-broadcast>
      
      <!-- Similar for webinar, conference, chat -->
    </ng-container>
  `
})
export class CustomUIPlaybookComponent {
  connectionScenario: 'cloud' | 'hybrid' | 'ce' = 'cloud';
  selectedExperience: 'generic' | 'broadcast' | 'webinar' | 'conference' | 'chat' = 'generic';
  showPrebuiltUI = true;
  enableFullCustomUI = false;

  connectionPresets = {
    cloud: { 
      credentials: { apiUserName: 'demo', apiKey: 'demo' }, 
      localLink: '', 
      connectMediaSFU: true 
    },
    hybrid: { 
      credentials: { apiUserName: 'demo', apiKey: 'demo' }, 
      localLink: 'http://localhost:3000', 
      connectMediaSFU: true 
    },
    ce: { 
      credentials: undefined, 
      localLink: 'http://localhost:3000', 
      connectMediaSFU: false 
    },
  };

  get currentPreset() {
    return this.connectionPresets[this.connectionScenario];
  }

  overrides: MediasfuUICustomOverrides = {
    mainContainer: this.enableFullCustomUI ? {
      component: CustomMainContainerComponent
    } : undefined,
  };

  containerStyle = {
    background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #0f172a, #1e3a8a)',
    minHeight: '100vh'
  };
}
```

Toggle the configuration values at the top of the playbook and watch the UI reconfigure instantly. It's the fastest path to understand MediaSFU's override surface before you fold the patterns into your production entrypoint.

#### Passing custom props and UI overrides

Use the same playbook to validate bespoke cards, override bundles, and fully custom workspaces before you move them into production code:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-advanced-playbook',
  template: `
    <app-mediasfu-generic
      [credentials]="credentials"
      [customVideoCard]="videoCard"
      [customAudioCard]="audioCard"
      [customMiniCard]="miniCard"
      [customMainComponent]="enableFullCustomUI ? customWorkspace : undefined"
      [containerStyle]="containerStyle"
      [uiOverrides]="uiOverrides">
    </app-mediasfu-generic>
  `
})
export class AdvancedPlaybookComponent {
  credentials = { apiUserName: 'demo', apiKey: 'demo' };
  enableFullCustomUI = false;

  // Custom card components with themed styling
  videoCard = VideoCardComponent; // Pass component class
  audioCard = AudioCardComponent;
  miniCard = MiniCardComponent;
  customWorkspace = CustomWorkspaceComponent;

  containerStyle = {
    background: '#0f172a',
    borderRadius: '32px',
    overflow: 'hidden'
  };

  uiOverrides: MediasfuUICustomOverrides = {
    mainContainer: {
      component: CustomMainContainerComponent
    },
    menuModal: {
      component: CustomMenuModalComponent
    },
    consumerResume: {
      wrap: (original) => async (params) => {
        const startedAt = performance.now();
        const result = await original(params);
        console.log('consumer_resume', {
          durationMs: performance.now() - startedAt,
          consumerId: params?.consumer?.id,
        });
        return result;
      },
    },
  };
}
```

Because the playbook surfaces `updateSourceParameters`, you can also log or snapshot the helper bundle (`getParticipantMedia`, `toggleMenuModal`, `showAlert`, and more) to ensure your custom UI always receives the hooks it expects.

### `uiOverrides` input — override keys at a glance

Each key accepts a `CustomComponentOverride<Props>` or `CustomFunctionOverride<Fn>` object with optional `component` and `wrap` fields. You can fully replace the default implementation or wrap it while forwarding props.

| `addVideosGrid` | `addVideosGrid` | Replace participant ordering or layout heuristics on the fly. |
| `prepopulateUserMedia` | `prepopulateUserMedia` | Customize initial media setup with custom video/audio/mini cards. |

> Function overrides support `{ implementation, wrap }`. Provide `implementation` for a full replacement, or `wrap` to intercept the default behavior before/after it runs.

### Example: swap the chat modal and theme the controls

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MediasfuGeneric } from 'mediasfu-angular';
import { MyChatModalComponent } from './ui/my-chat-modal.component';
import { MyControlsComponent } from './ui/my-controls.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-meeting',
  template: `
    <app-mediasfu-generic
      [credentials]="credentials"
      [uiOverrides]="uiOverrides">
    </app-mediasfu-generic>
  `
})
export class MyMeetingComponent {
  credentials = { apiUserName: 'your-api-user', apiKey: 'your-api-key' };

  uiOverrides = {
    messagesModal: {
      component: MyChatModalComponent,
    },
    controlButtons: {
      component: MyControlsComponent,
    },
  };
}
```

### Example: wrap a MediaSFU helper instead of replacing it

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MediasfuConference } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-analytics-meeting',
  template: `
    <app-mediasfu-conference
      [credentials]="credentials"
      [uiOverrides]="uiOverrides">
    </app-mediasfu-conference>
  `
})
export class AnalyticsMeetingComponent {
  credentials = { apiUserName: 'your-api-user', apiKey: 'your-api-key' };

  uiOverrides = {
    consumerResume: {
      wrap: (original) => async (params) => {
        const startedAt = performance.now();
        const result = await original(params);
        
        // Send analytics
        this.analytics.track('consumer_resume', {
          durationMs: performance.now() - startedAt,
          consumerId: params?.consumer?.id,
        });
        
        return result;
      },
    },
  };

  constructor(private analytics: AnalyticsService) {}
}
```

9. **Cloud Recording (track-based)**: Customize recordings with track-based options, including watermarks, name tags, background colors, and more.
10. **Managed Events**: Manage events with features to handle abandoned and inactive participants, as well as enforce time and capacity limits.

## 🆕 **New Advanced Media Access**

The Angular SDK now includes powerful utility methods for fine-grained control over media devices and participant streams:

### **`getMediaDevicesList`** - Device Enumeration

Enumerate available cameras and microphones with automatic permission handling:

```typescript
// Get all available cameras
const cameras = await sourceParameters.getMediaDevicesList('videoinput');
cameras.forEach(camera => {
  console.log(`Camera: ${camera.label} (${camera.deviceId})`);
});

// Get all available microphones
const microphones = await sourceParameters.getMediaDevicesList('audioinput');
microphones.forEach(mic => {
  console.log(`Microphone: ${mic.label} (${mic.deviceId})`);
});
```

**Use Cases:**
- Build custom device selection interfaces
- Detect available media hardware
- Switch between multiple cameras/microphones
- Pre-flight device checks before joining

See full documentation and examples →

---

### **`getParticipantMedia`** - Stream Access

Retrieve specific participant's video or audio streams by ID or name:

```typescript
// Get participant video stream by producer ID
const videoStream = await sourceParameters.getParticipantMedia({
  id: 'producer-123',
  kind: 'video'
});

// Get participant audio stream by name
const audioStream = await sourceParameters.getParticipantMedia({
  name: 'John Doe',
  kind: 'audio'
});

// Use the stream (e.g., attach to video element)
if (videoStream) {
  videoElement.srcObject = videoStream;
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Monitor specific participant streams
- Create custom video layouts with individual control
- Build stream recording features
- Implement advanced audio/video processing
- Create picture-in-picture views for specific users

See full documentation and examples →

---

These utilities enable advanced features like custom device selection interfaces, participant stream monitoring, and dynamic media routing. Both methods are fully integrated with Angular's reactive patterns using RxJS.

# Getting Started

This section will guide users through the initial setup and installation of the npm module.

### Documentation Reference

For comprehensive documentation on the available methods, components, and functions, please visit [mediasfu.com](https://www.mediasfu.com/angular/). This resource provides detailed information for this guide and additional documentation.


## Installation

Instructions on how to install the module using npm.

### 1. **Add the package to your project**

    ```bash
  npm install mediasfu-angular bootstrap ngx-cookie-service socket.io-client mediasoup-client @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons

  # Optional but recommended for virtual backgrounds and scanner-based flows
  npm install @mediapipe/selfie_segmentation @zxing/ngx-scanner
    ```

### 2. **Bootstrap Integration**

  The `mediasfu-angular` package expects Bootstrap as a peer dependency. If your Angular app does not already ship with Bootstrap, install it and ensure Bootstrap's CSS is added to your project's styles.

    1. **Check `angular.json`:**

      Ensure that `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css` is listed in the `styles` array of your Angular application's build options.

      ```json
      {
        "projects": {
          "your-app-name": {
            "architect": {
              "build": {
                "options": {
                  "styles": [
                    "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
                    "src/styles.css"
                  ],
                  // ... other configurations
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

  **Note:** `mediasfu-angular` does not bundle Bootstrap for you. Keep the CSS import explicit so your app and the SDK agree on styling.


### 3. **Configure MediaSFU's PreJoinPage Requirements**

    If you intend to use MediaSFU's `PreJoinPage` component, additional configuration is required. Provide `HttpClient` and `CookieService` in your application's configuration, and make sure `ngx-cookie-service` is installed in your Angular app.

    #### Update `app.config.ts`

    Add the necessary providers to your `app.config.ts` file. Below is an example configuration:

    ```typescript
    // app.config.ts
    import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
    import { provideZoneChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';
    import { provideClientHydration } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { provideHttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
    import { CookieService } from 'ngx-cookie-service';

    export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
      providers: [
        provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),
        provideClientHydration(),
        provideHttpClient(),
        CookieService
      ],
    };

    ```

### 4. Obtain an API Key (If Required) 
   You can get your API key by signing up or logging into your account at [mediasfu.com](https://www.mediasfu.com/).


## **Self-Hosting MediaSFU**  

If you plan to self-host MediaSFU or use it without MediaSFU Cloud services, you don't need an API key. You can access the open-source version of MediaSFU from the [MediaSFU Open Repository](https://github.com/MediaSFU/MediaSFUOpen).  

This setup allows full flexibility and customization while bypassing the need for cloud-dependent credentials.

```

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **Event Room Types**

MediaSFU provides 5 specialized room types, each optimized for specific use cases:

| Room Type | Best For | Key Features |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **MediasfuGeneric** | General purpose meetings | Flexible layout, all features enabled |
| **MediasfuBroadcast** | Live streaming events | Optimized for one-to-many communication |
| **MediasfuWebinar** | Educational sessions | Presenter focus, Q&A features |
| **MediasfuConference** | Business meetings | Equal participant layout, collaboration tools |
| **MediasfuChat** | Interactive discussions | Chat-first interface, quick connections |

```typescript
// Choose the right room type for your use case
import { 
  MediasfuWebinar, 
  MediasfuBroadcast, 
  MediasfuConference 
} from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  // For a webinar
  template: `<app-mediasfu-webinar [credentials]="credentials"></app-mediasfu-webinar>`,
  // For a broadcast
  // template: `<app-mediasfu-broadcast [credentials]="credentials"></app-mediasfu-broadcast>`,
  // For a conference
  // template: `<app-mediasfu-conference [credentials]="credentials"></app-mediasfu-conference>`,
})
```

#### 2. **The Three Usage Modes**

MediaSFU offers three progressive levels of customization:

##### Mode 1: Default UI (Beginner / Fastest Path)
Use MediaSFU's complete pre-built interface - perfect for rapid development.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MediasfuGeneric } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [MediasfuGeneric],
  template: `<app-mediasfu-generic [credentials]="credentials"></app-mediasfu-generic>`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  credentials = { apiUserName: 'username', apiKey: 'key' };
}
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Prototyping or MVP development
- ✅ Need a production-ready UI quickly
- ✅ Standard video conferencing features are sufficient

##### Mode 2: Headless Runtime + Custom UI (Intermediate)
Build your own UI while using MediaSFU's powerful backend infrastructure.

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { MediasfuGeneric } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [MediasfuGeneric, CommonModule],
  template: `
    <app-mediasfu-generic
      [returnUI]="false"
      [sourceParameters]="sourceParameters"
      [updateSourceParameters]="updateSourceParameters.bind(this)"
      [credentials]="credentials"
      [noUIPreJoinOptions]="preJoinOptions">
    </app-mediasfu-generic>

    <!-- Your custom UI -->
    @if (sourceParameters) {
      <div class="custom-controls">
        <button (click)="toggleVideo()">
          {{ sourceParameters.videoAlreadyOn ? 'Stop Video' : 'Start Video' }}
        </button>
        <button (click)="toggleAudio()">
          {{ sourceParameters.audioAlreadyOn ? 'Mute' : 'Unmute' }}
        </button>
        <button (click)="toggleScreenShare()">
          {{ sourceParameters.screenAlreadyOn ? 'Stop Sharing' : 'Share Screen' }}
        </button>
      </div>
    }
  `,
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  sourceParameters: any = null;
  credentials = { apiUserName: 'username', apiKey: 'key' };
  preJoinOptions = {
    action: 'create',
    userName: 'Your Name',
    capacity: 50,
    duration: 30,
    eventType: 'conference'
  };

  updateSourceParameters(params: any) {
    this.sourceParameters = params;
  }

  toggleVideo() {
    this.sourceParameters?.clickVideo({ parameters: this.sourceParameters });
  }

  toggleAudio() {
    this.sourceParameters?.clickAudio({ parameters: this.sourceParameters });
  }

  toggleScreenShare() {
    this.sourceParameters?.clickScreenShare({ parameters: this.sourceParameters });
  }
}
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Need complete control over UI/UX
- ✅ Building a custom branded experience
- ✅ Integrating into existing app design

##### Mode 3: Custom Main Shell (Advanced)
Replace specific MediaSFU components while keeping the rest of the infrastructure.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { 
  MediasfuGeneric, 
  PreJoinPage,
  FlexibleVideo, 
  FlexibleGrid 
} from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-main',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [FlexibleVideo, FlexibleGrid, CommonModule],
  template: `
    <div class="custom-layout">
      <!-- Custom header -->
      <div class="custom-header">
        <h1>{{ parameters.roomName }}</h1>
        <span>{{ parameters.participants.length }} participants</span>
      </div>

      <!-- Use MediaSFU's components in your layout -->
      <app-flexible-video
        [customWidth]="windowWidth"
        [customHeight]="600"
        [parameters]="parameters">
      </app-flexible-video>

      <app-flexible-grid
        [customWidth]="windowWidth"
        [customHeight]="400"
        [parameters]="parameters">
      </app-flexible-grid>

      <!-- Custom footer -->
      <div class="custom-footer">
        <button (click)="toggleVideo()">
          {{ parameters.videoAlreadyOn ? 'Stop Video' : 'Start Video' }}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .custom-layout { 
      display: flex; 
      flex-direction: column; 
      height: 100vh; 
    }
    .custom-header { 
      padding: 20px; 
      background: #1976d2; 
      color: white; 
    }
  `]
})
export class CustomMainComponent {
  parameters: any;
  windowWidth = window.innerWidth;

  toggleVideo() {
    this.parameters?.clickVideo({ parameters: this.parameters });
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [MediasfuGeneric],
  template: `
    <app-mediasfu-generic
      [credentials]="credentials"
      [PrejoinPage]="PreJoinPage"
      [customMainComponent]="CustomMainComponent">
    </app-mediasfu-generic>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  PreJoinPage = PreJoinPage;
  CustomMainComponent = CustomMainComponent;
  credentials = { apiUserName: 'username', apiKey: 'key' };
}
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Need custom main interface but want to keep MediaSFU's components
- ✅ Partial customization with minimal effort
- ✅ Want to maintain MediaSFU's functionality while customizing layout

#### 3. **Parameters: Your Control Center**

The `sourceParameters` object (or `parameters` in custom components) is your gateway to all MediaSFU functionality. It's powered by RxJS BehaviorSubjects for reactive state management:

```typescript
// Available in sourceParameters or parameters object
{
  // Media Controls (Methods)
  clickVideo: (options) => {},
  clickAudio: (options) => {},
  clickScreenShare: (options) => {},
  
  // Room State (BehaviorSubject values)
  roomName: 'meeting-123',
  participants: [...],
  allVideoStreams: [...],
  allAudioStreams: [...],
  
  // UI State (BehaviorSubject values)
  videoAlreadyOn: false,
  audioAlreadyOn: false,
  screenAlreadyOn: false,
  
  // Update Functions (BehaviorSubject next())
  updateVideoAlreadyOn: (value) => {},
  updateAudioAlreadyOn: (value) => {},
  
  // And 200+ more properties and methods...
}
```

**Access patterns:**

```typescript
// In Mode 1 (Default UI): Parameters are managed internally
// You don't need to access them directly

// In Mode 2 (Custom UI): Access via sourceParameters
sourceParameters?.clickVideo({ parameters: sourceParameters });

// In Mode 3 (Custom Main Shell): Passed to your custom main component
@Component({
  template: `<button (click)="toggleVideo()">Toggle</button>`
})
export class CustomRoomShellComponent {
  @Input() parameters: any;
  
  toggleVideo() {
    this.parameters.clickVideo({ parameters: this.parameters });
  }
}

// Subscribing to reactive state changes
sourceParameters.participants.subscribe((participants) => {
  console.log('Participants updated:', participants);
});
```

## Core Concepts & Components

Now that you understand the architecture, let's explore the building blocks.

### 1. Display Components: Building Your Video Layout

MediaSFU provides powerful components for organizing and displaying media streams.

#### Primary Layout Components

**FlexibleVideo** - Main video display area

```typescript
import { FlexibleVideo } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  template: `
    <app-flexible-video
      [customWidth]="windowWidth"
      [customHeight]="600"
      [parameters]="parameters">
    </app-flexible-video>
  `
})
```
- Automatically handles main presenter or screen share
- Smooth transitions between different video sources
- Responsive sizing

**FlexibleGrid** - Participant grid layout

```typescript
import { FlexibleGrid } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  template: `
    <app-flexible-grid
      [customWidth]="windowWidth"
      [customHeight]="800"
      [parameters]="parameters">
    </app-flexible-grid>
  `
})
```
- Intelligent grid sizing (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc.)
- Pagination for large participant lists
- Automatic reflow on window resize

**AudioGrid** - Audio-only participants

```typescript
import { AudioGrid } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  template: `<app-audio-grid [parameters]="parameters"></app-audio-grid>`
})
```
- Displays participants without video
- Audio level indicators
- Compact layout for efficiency

#### Container Components

| **MainContainerComponent** | Primary content wrapper | Wraps all main content areas |
| **MainAspectComponent** | Aspect ratio container | Maintains proper video proportions |
| **MainScreenComponent** | Screen layout manager | Organizes screen regions |
| **SubAspectComponent** | Secondary content container | For picture-in-picture, sidebars |

**Example: Building a custom layout**

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import {
  MainContainerComponent,
  FlexibleVideo,
  FlexibleGrid,
  AudioGrid
} from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-layout',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [
    MainContainerComponent,
    FlexibleVideo,
    FlexibleGrid,
    AudioGrid,
    CommonModule
  ],
  template: `
    <app-main-container-component>
      <div class="layout-container">
        <!-- Main video area -->
        <div class="main-video">
          <app-flexible-video
            [customWidth]="windowWidth"
            [customHeight]="windowHeight * 0.6"
            [parameters]="parameters">
          </app-flexible-video>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Participant grid -->
        <div class="participant-grid">
          <app-flexible-grid
            [customWidth]="windowWidth"
            [customHeight]="windowHeight * 0.3"
            [parameters]="parameters">
          </app-flexible-grid>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Audio-only participants -->
        <div class="audio-participants">
          <app-audio-grid [parameters]="parameters"></app-audio-grid>
        </div>
      </div>
    </app-main-container-component>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .layout-container {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      height: 100vh;
    }
    .main-video { flex: 3; }
    .participant-grid { flex: 2; }
    .audio-participants { height: 80px; }
  `]
})
export class CustomLayoutComponent {
  @Input() parameters: any;
  windowWidth = window.innerWidth;
  windowHeight = window.innerHeight;
}
```

### 2. Control Components: User Interactions

**ControlButtonsComponent** - Standard control bar

## Working with Methods

MediaSFU provides 200+ methods for controlling every aspect of your real-time communication experience. Let's explore the most important categories.

### Media Control Methods

#### Video Control

```typescript
// Toggle video on/off
parameters.clickVideo({ parameters });

// Switch camera (front/back on mobile)
parameters.switchVideoAlt({ parameters });

// Switch to specific camera by ID
const cameras = await parameters.getMediaDevicesList('videoinput');
parameters.switchUserVideo({
  videoPreference: cameras[1].deviceId,
  parameters
});

// Get current video state
const isVideoOn = parameters.videoAlreadyOn;

// Subscribe to video state changes (RxJS)
parameters.videoAlreadyOn.subscribe((isOn: boolean) => {
  console.log('Video is now:', isOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF');
});

// Update video state programmatically
parameters.updateVideoAlreadyOn.next(true);
```

#### Audio Control

```typescript
// Toggle audio on/off
parameters.clickAudio({ parameters });

// Switch microphone
const microphones = await parameters.getMediaDevicesList('audioinput');
parameters.switchUserAudio({
  audioPreference: microphones[1].deviceId,
  parameters
});

// Get current audio state
const isAudioOn = parameters.audioAlreadyOn;
const hasHostPermission = parameters.micAction; // Host approval status

// Subscribe to audio state changes
parameters.audioAlreadyOn.subscribe((isOn: boolean) => {
  console.log('Audio is now:', isOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF');
});

// Mute/unmute specific participant (host only)
parameters.controlMedia({
  participantId: 'participant-id',
  participantName: 'John Doe',
  type: 'audio',
  socket: parameters.socket,
  roomName: parameters.roomName
});
```

#### Screen Sharing

```typescript
// Start screen sharing
parameters.clickScreenShare({ parameters });

// Stop screen sharing
parameters.stopShareScreen({ parameters });

// Check if screen sharing is available
const canShare = await parameters.checkScreenShare({ parameters });

// Get screen share state
const isSharing = parameters.screenAlreadyOn;
const shareAudio = parameters.shareScreenStarted; // Sharing with audio

// Subscribe to screen share state
parameters.screenAlreadyOn.subscribe((isSharing: boolean) => {
  console.log('Screen sharing:', isSharing ? 'ACTIVE' : 'INACTIVE');
});
```

### Media Device and Stream Utility Methods

#### Get Available Media Devices

```typescript
// Get available cameras
const cameras = await parameters.getMediaDevicesList('videoinput');
cameras.forEach(camera => {
  console.log(`Camera: ${camera.label} (${camera.deviceId})`);
});

// Get available microphones
const microphones = await parameters.getMediaDevicesList('audioinput');
microphones.forEach(mic => {
  console.log(`Microphone: ${mic.label} (${mic.deviceId})`);
});

// Building a device selector UI
@Component({
  selector: 'app-device-selector',
  template: `
    <div class="device-selector">
      <select (change)="onCameraChange($event)">
        <option value="">Select Camera</option>
        @for (camera of cameras; track camera.deviceId) {
          <option [value]="camera.deviceId">
            {{ camera.label }}
          </option>
        }
      </select>

      <select (change)="onMicrophoneChange($event)">

        @for (mic of microphones; track mic.deviceId) {
          <option [value]="mic.deviceId">
            {{ mic.label }}
          </option>
        }
      </select>
    </div>
  `
})
export class DeviceSelectorComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() parameters: any;
  cameras: MediaDeviceInfo[] = [];
  microphones: MediaDeviceInfo[] = [];

  async ngOnInit() {
    await this.loadDevices();
  }

  async loadDevices() {
    this.cameras = await this.parameters.getMediaDevicesList('videoinput');
    this.microphones = await this.parameters.getMediaDevicesList('audioinput');

      parameters: this.parameters
    });
  }

  onMicrophoneChange(event: any) {
    this.parameters.switchUserAudio({
      audioPreference: event.target.value,
      parameters: this.parameters
    });
  }
}
```

#### Get Participant Media Streams

```typescript
// Get participant video stream by ID
const videoStream = await parameters.getParticipantMedia({ 
  id: 'producer-123', 
  kind: 'video'

## Programmatically Fetching Tokens

If you prefer to fetch the required tokens programmatically without visiting MediaSFU's website, you can use the `PreJoinPage` component and pass your credentials as inputs.

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MediasfuGeneric, PreJoinPage } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [MediasfuGeneric],
  template: `
    <div class="container">
      <app-mediasfu-generic
        [PrejoinPage]="PreJoinPage"
        [credentials]="credentials">
      </app-mediasfu-generic>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  // Reference to the PreJoinPage component
  PreJoinPage = PreJoinPage;

  // MediaSFU account credentials
  credentials = {
    apiUserName: 'yourAPIUserName',
    apiKey: 'yourAPIKey',
  };
}
```


### Preview of Welcome Page


&nbsp;

### Preview of Prejoin Page


## Custom Welcome/Prejoin Page

Alternatively, you can design your own welcome/prejoin page. The core function of this page is to fetch user tokens from MediaSFU's API and establish a connection with the returned link if valid.

### Parameters Passed to Custom Page

MediaSFU passes relevant parameters to the custom welcome/prejoin page:

```javascript
let { showAlert, updateIsLoadingModalVisible, connectSocket, updateSocket, updateValidated,
     updateApiUserName, updateApiToken, updateLink, updateRoomName, updateMember } = parameters;
```

Ensure that your custom page implements the following updates:

```javascript
updateSocket(socket);
updateApiUserName(apiUserName);
updateApiToken(apiToken);
updateLink(link);
updateRoomName(apiUserName);
updateMember(userName);
updateValidated(true);
```

See the following code for the PreJoinPage page logic:

### IP Blockage Warning And Local UI Development

 **Note:** Local UI Development Mode is deprecated. Rather use your own Community Edition (CE) server for UI development and testing. You can later switch to MediaSFU Cloud for production. Nothing changes in the codebase, and you can use the same code for both environments.

Entering the event room without the correct credentials may result in IP blockage, as the page automatically attempts to connect with MediaSFU servers, which rate limit bad requests based on IP address.

If users attempt to enter the event room without valid credentials or tokens, it may lead to IP blockage due to MediaSFU servers' rate limiting mechanism. To avoid unintentional connections to MediaSFU servers during UI development, users can pass the `useLocalUIMode` parameter as `true`.

In this mode, the module will operate locally without making requests to MediaSFU servers. However, to render certain UI elements such as messages, participants, requests, etc., users may need to provide seed data. They can achieve this by importing random data generators and passing the generated data to the event room component.

### Example for Generic UI to Render Broadcast Room

### Example for Generic View

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import {
  GenerateRandomParticipants,
  GenerateRandomMessages,
  GenerateRandomRequestList,
  GenerateRandomWaitingRoomList,
  MediasfuGeneric,
  MediasfuBroadcast,
  MediasfuChat,
  MediasfuWebinar,
  MediasfuConference,
  PreJoinPage,
} from 'mediasfu-angular';

// Assume all missing imports are similar to the previous example


/**
 * AppComponent
 *
 * This component demonstrates how to:
 * - Configure credentials for MediaSFU Cloud and/or Community Edition (CE).
 * - Use MediaSFU with or without a custom server.
 * - Integrate a pre-join page.
 * - Disable the default MediaSFU UI and manage state through `sourceParameters` for a fully custom frontend.
 *
 * Basic instructions:
 * 1. Set `localLink` to your CE server if you have one, or leave it blank to use MediaSFU Cloud.
 * 2. Set `connectMediaSFU` to determine whether you're connecting to MediaSFU Cloud services.
 * 3. Provide credentials if using MediaSFU Cloud (dummy credentials are acceptable in certain scenarios).
 * 4. If you prefer a custom UI, set `returnUI` to false and handle all interactions via `sourceParameters` and `updateSourceParameters`.
 * 5. For secure production usage, use custom `createMediaSFURoom` and `joinMediaSFURoom` functions to forward requests through your backend.

  // =========================================================
  //
  // Scenario A: Not using MediaSFU Cloud at all.
  // - No credentials needed. Just set localLink to your CE server.
  // Example:
  /*
  credentials = {};
  localLink = 'http://your-ce-server.com'; // e.g., 'http://localhost:3000'
  connectMediaSFU = localLink.trim() !== '';
  */

  // Scenario B: Using MediaSFU CE + MediaSFU Cloud for Egress only.
  // - Use dummy credentials (8 characters for userName, 64 characters for apiKey).
  // - Your CE backend will forward requests with your real credentials.
  /*
  credentials = {
    apiUserName: 'dummyUsr', // 8 characters
    apiKey: '1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef', // 64 characters
  };
  localLink = 'http://your-ce-server.com'; // e.g., 'http://localhost:3000'
  connectMediaSFU = localLink.trim() !== '';
  */

  // Scenario C: Using MediaSFU Cloud without your own server.
  // - For development, use your actual or dummy credentials.
  // - In production, securely handle credentials server-side and use custom room functions.
  credentials = {
    apiUserName: 'yourDevUser', // 8 characters recommended for dummy
    apiKey: 'yourDevApiKey1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef', // 64 characters

  connectMediaSFU = true; // Set to true if using MediaSFU Cloud since localLink is empty

  // =========================================================
  //                    UI RENDERING OPTIONS
  // =========================================================
  //
  // If you want a fully custom UI (e.g., a custom layout inspired by WhatsApp):
  // 1. Set `returnUI = false` to prevent the default MediaSFU UI from rendering.
  // 2. Provide `noUIPreJoinOptions` to simulate what would have been entered on a pre-join page.
  // 3. Use `sourceParameters` and `updateSourceParameters` to access and update state/actions.
  // 4. No need for any of the above if you're using the default MediaSFU UI.
  //
  // Example noUIPreJoinOptions for creating a room:
  noUIPreJoinOptions: CreateMediaSFURoomOptions | JoinMediaSFURoomOptions = {
    action: 'create',
    capacity: 10,
    duration: 15,
    eventType: 'broadcast',
    userName: 'Prince',
  };

  // Example noUIPreJoinOptions for joining a room:
  // noUIPreJoinOptions: CreateMediaSFURoomOptions | JoinMediaSFURoomOptions = {
  //   action: 'join',
  //   userName: 'Prince',
  //   meetingID: 'yourMeetingID'
  // };

  returnUI = true; // Set to false for custom UI, true for default MediaSFU UI

    this.sourceParameters = data;
  };

  // =========================================================
  //                CUSTOM ROOM FUNCTIONS (OPTIONAL)
  // =========================================================
  //
  // To securely forward requests to MediaSFU:
  // - Implement custom `createMediaSFURoom` and `joinMediaSFURoom` functions.
  // - These functions send requests to your server, which then communicates with MediaSFU Cloud.
  //
  // The imported `createRoomOnMediaSFU` and `joinRoomOnMediaSFU` are examples.
  //
  // If using MediaSFU CE backend, ensure your server endpoints:
  // - Validate dummy credentials.
  // - Forward requests to mediasfu.com with real credentials.

/**
 * =========================================================
 *                     ADDITIONAL NOTES
 * =========================================================
 *
 * Handling Core Methods:
 * Once `sourceParameters` is populated, you can call core methods like `clickVideo` or `clickAudio` directly:
 * Example:
 * sourceParameters.clickVideo({ ...sourceParameters });
 * sourceParameters.clickAudio({ ...sourceParameters });
 *
 * This allows your custom UI to directly interact with MediaSFU functionalities.
 *
 * Deprecated Features (Seed Data):
 * The seed data generation feature is deprecated. Avoid using `useLocalUIMode` or `useSeed` in new implementations.
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - **Protect API Credentials:** Ensure that API credentials are not exposed in the frontend. Use environment variables and secure backend services to handle sensitive information.
 * - **Use HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to secure data transmission between the client and server.
 * - **Validate Inputs:** Implement proper validation and error handling on both client and server sides to prevent malicious inputs.
 *
 * Example CE Backend Setup:
 * If using MediaSFU CE + MediaSFU Cloud, your backend might look like this:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // Endpoint for `createRoom`
 * app.post("/createRoom", async (req, res) => {
 *   try {
 *     const payload = req.body;
 *     const [apiUserName, apiKey] = req.headers.authorization
 *       .replace("Bearer ", "")
 *       .split(":");
 *
 *     // Verify temporary credentials
 *     if (!apiUserName || !apiKey || !verifyCredentials(apiUserName, apiKey)) {
 *       return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid or expired credentials" });
 *     }
 *
 *     const response = await fetch("https://mediasfu.com/v1/rooms/", {
 *       method: "POST",
 *       headers: {
 *         "Content-Type": "application/json",
 *         Authorization: `Bearer ${actualApiUserName}:${actualApiKey}`,
 *       },
 *       body: JSON.stringify(payload),
 *     });
 *
 *     const result = await response.json();
 *     res.status(response.status).json(result);
 *   } catch (error) {
 *     console.error("Error creating room:", error);
 *     res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" });
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // Endpoint for `joinRoom`
 * app.post("/joinRoom", async (req, res) => {
 *   try {
 *     const payload = req.body;
 *     const [apiUserName, apiKey] = req.headers.authorization
 *       .replace("Bearer ", "")
 *       .split(":");
 *
 *     // Verify temporary credentials
 *     if (!apiUserName || !apiKey || !verifyCredentials(apiUserName, apiKey)) {
 *       return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid or expired credentials" });
 *     }
 *
 *     const response = await fetch("https://mediasfu.com/v1/rooms/", {
 *       method: "POST",
 *       headers: {
 *         "Content-Type": "application/json",
 *         Authorization: `Bearer ${actualApiUserName}:${actualApiKey}`,
 *       },
 *       body: JSON.stringify(payload),
 *     });
 *
 *     const result = await response.json();
 *     res.status(response.status).json(result);
 *   } catch (error) {
 *     console.error("Error joining room:", error);
 *     res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" });
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Custom Room Function Implementation:
 * Below are examples of how to implement custom functions for creating and joining rooms securely:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { CreateJoinRoomError, CreateJoinRoomResponse, CreateJoinRoomType, CreateMediaSFURoomOptions, JoinMediaSFURoomOptions } from '../../@types/types';
 *

In the provided examples, users can set `useLocalUIMode` to `true` during UI development to prevent unwanted connections to MediaSFU servers. Additionally, they can generate seed data for rendering UI components locally by using random data generators provided by the module.

### Local UI Development in MediaSFU Angular Module


During local UI development, the MediaSFU view is designed to be responsive to changes in screen size and orientation, adapting its layout accordingly. However, since UI changes are typically linked to communication with servers, developing the UI locally might result in less responsiveness due to the lack of real-time data updates. To mitigate this, users can force trigger changes in the UI by rotating the device, resizing the window, or simulating server responses by clicking on buttons within the page.

While developing locally, users may encounter occasional error warnings as the UI attempts to communicate with the server. These warnings can be safely ignored, as they are simply indicative of unsuccessful server requests in the local development environment.

If users experience responsiveness issues, whether during local development or in production, they can optimize their HTML configuration to ensure proper scaling and viewport settings. By adding the following meta tag to the HTML `<head>` section, users can specify viewport settings for optimal display:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no" />
```


# Intermediate Usage Guide

Expands on the basic usage, covering more advanced features and scenarios.

### Intermediate Usage Guide

In the Intermediate Usage Guide, we'll explore the core components and functionalities of the MediaSFU Angular module, focusing on media display, controls, and modal interactions. **Click on any listed component/method to open the full documentation.**


#### Core Components Overview

The main items displayed on an event page are media components (such as video, audio, and blank cards) and control components (for pagination, navigation, etc.).

> ##### **Media Display Components**

| Component Name           | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Room Socket Events

In the context of a room's real-time communication, various events occur, such as user actions, room management updates, media controls, and meeting status changes. To effectively handle these events and synchronize the application's state with the server, specific functions are provided. These functions act as listeners for socket events, allowing the application to react accordingly.

      participants: this.participants.value,
      updateScreenId: this.updateScreenId.bind(this),
      updateShareScreenStarted: this.updateShareScreenStarted.bind(this),
      updateDeferScreenReceived: this.updateDeferScreenReceived.bind(this),
    });
  });


  this.socket.value.on('updateMediaSettings', async ({ settings }: { settings: Settings }) => {
    this.updateMediaSettings.updateMediaSettings({
      settings,
      updateAudioSetting: this.updateAudioSetting.bind(this),
      updateVideoSetting: this.updateVideoSetting.bind(this),
      updateScreenshareSetting: this.updateScreenshareSetting.bind(this),
      updateChatSetting: this.updateChatSetting.bind(this),
    });
  });

}
```

These functions enable seamless interaction with the server and ensure that the application stays synchronized with the real-time events occurring within the room.

### Customizing Media Display in MediaSFU

By default, media display in MediaSFU is handled by the following key functions:

- **`prepopulateUserMedia`**: This function controls the main media grid, such as the host's video in webinar or broadcast views (MainGrid).
- **`addVideosGrid`**: This function manages the mini grid's media, such as participants' media in MiniGrid views (MiniCards, AudioCards, VideoCards).

#### Customizing the Media Display

If you want to modify the default content displayed by MediaSFU components, such as the `MiniCard`, `AudioCard`, or `VideoCard`, you can replace the default UI with your own custom components.

To implement your custom UI for media display:

1. **Custom MainGrid (Host's Video)**: 
   - Modify the UI in the `prepopulateUserMedia` function. 
   - Example link to MediaSFU's default implementation: [`prepopulateUserMedia`](https://github.com/MediaSFU/MediaSFU-Angular/tree/main/src/lib/consumers/prepopulate-user-media.service.ts).

2. **Custom MiniGrid (Participants' Media)**:
   - Modify the UI in the `addVideosGrid` function.
   - Example link to MediaSFU's default implementation: [`addVideosGrid`](https://github.com/MediaSFU/MediaSFU-Angular/tree/main/src/lib/consumers/add-videos-grid.service.ts).

To create a custom UI, you can refer to existing MediaSFU implementations like:

- [MediasfuGeneric](https://github.com/MediaSFU/MediaSFU-Angular/tree/main/src/lib/components/mediasfu-components/mediasfu-generic.component.ts)
- [MediasfuBroadcast](https://github.com/MediaSFU/MediaSFU-Angular/tree/main/src/lib/components/mediasfu-components/mediasfu-broadcast.component.ts)

Once your custom components are built, modify the imports of `prepopulateUserMedia` and `addVideosGrid` to point to your custom implementations instead of the default MediaSFU ones.

This allows for full flexibility in how media is displayed in both the main and mini grids, giving you the ability to tailor the user experience to your specific needs.

## UI Component Customization & Override System

MediaSFU provides comprehensive customization capabilities for all UI components through a powerful override system. You can customize styling, inject custom templates, or completely replace components with your own implementations.

### Overview

The customization system operates at three levels:

1. **Style Overrides**: Apply custom CSS styles to containers, overlays, and content areas
2. **Template Injection**: Replace default component templates with custom Angular templates
3. **Component Replacement**: Completely replace MediaSFU components with your own using the `WithOverrideDirective`

### 1. Style Customization

All display and modal components support style customization through Input properties:

#### Display Components (MainContainer, MainAspect, MainScreen, MainGrid, OtherGrid, SubAspect, FlexibleGrid, AudioGrid)

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-meeting',
  template: `
    <app-main-container
      [containerStyle]="{
        backgroundColor: '#1a1a1a',
        border: '2px solid #333',
        borderRadius: '12px',
        padding: '20px'
      }"
      [backgroundColor]="'transparent'">
    </app-main-container>
    
    <app-flexible-grid
      [containerStyle]="{
        display: 'grid',
        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
        gap: '16px'
      }">
    </app-flexible-grid>
  `
})
export class MyMeetingComponent {
  // Custom styles can also be dynamic
  mainGridStyle: Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration> = {
    backgroundColor: '#2a2a2a',
    maxWidth: '1400px',
    margin: '0 auto'
  };
}
```

#### Modal Components (All modals support overlayStyle, contentStyle)

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-modal-example',
  template: `
    <!-- Participants Modal with custom styling -->
    <app-participants-modal
      [isParticipantsModalVisible]="true"
      [overlayStyle]="{
        backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)',
        backdropFilter: 'blur(8px)'
      }"
      [contentStyle]="{
        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
        borderRadius: '16px',
        boxShadow: '0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)',
        maxWidth: '600px',
        padding: '24px'
      }">
    </app-participants-modal>
    
    <!-- Recording Modal with custom theme -->
    <app-recording-modal
      [isRecordingModalVisible]="true"
      [contentStyle]="{
        backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5',
        border: '3px solid #007bff',
        fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif'
      }">
    </app-recording-modal>
  `
})
export class CustomModalExample {
  // Styles can be computed or conditional
  get modalOverlay(): Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration> {
    return {
      backgroundColor: this.isDarkMode ? 'rgba(0,0,0,0.9)' : 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)'
    };
  }
}
```

### 2. Template Injection

Replace default component templates with custom Angular templates using `TemplateRef`:

```typescript
import { Component, TemplateRef, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-template-demo',
  template: `
    <!-- Define custom template -->
    <ng-template #customMainGridTemplate let-components="components">
      <div class="my-custom-grid">
        <div class="grid-header">
          <h3>Active Participants</h3>
          <span class="count">{{ components?.length || 0 }}</span>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-content">
          <!-- Custom rendering logic -->
          <div *ngFor="let component of components" class="participant-tile">
            <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="component"></ng-container>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </ng-template>
    
    <!-- Use custom template -->
    <app-main-grid
      [customTemplate]="customMainGridTemplate"
      [mainGridStream]="streams">
    </app-main-grid>
    
    <!-- Custom modal template -->
    <ng-template #customAlertTemplate let-message="message" let-type="type">
      <div class="custom-alert" [class.error]="type === 'error'">
        <i class="alert-icon"></i>
        <p>{{ message }}</p>
        <button (click)="closeAlert()">Dismiss</button>
      </div>
    </ng-template>
    
    <app-alert-component
      [customTemplate]="customAlertTemplate"
      [visible]="showAlert"
      [message]="alertMessage">
    </app-alert-component>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .my-custom-grid {
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
      border-radius: 12px;
      padding: 20px;
    }
    
    .grid-header {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      color: white;
      margin-bottom: 16px;
    }
    
    .participant-tile {
      background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
      border-radius: 8px;
      padding: 12px;
      margin: 8px 0;
    }
  `]
})
export class CustomTemplateDemo {
  @ViewChild('customMainGridTemplate') customMainGridTemplate!: TemplateRef<any>;
  @ViewChild('customAlertTemplate') customAlertTemplate!: TemplateRef<any>;
  
  streams: any[] = [];
  showAlert = false;
  alertMessage = '';
  
  closeAlert() {
    this.showAlert = false;
  }
}
```

### 3. Component Replacement with UI Overrides

Use the `uiOverrides` system to completely replace MediaSFU components with your own:

```typescript
import { Component, Type } from '@angular/core';
import { MediasfuUICustomOverrides } from 'mediasfu-angular';

// Your custom replacement components
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-custom-video-card',
  template: `
    <div class="premium-video-card">
      <video [srcObject]="videoStream" autoplay></video>
      <div class="overlay">
        <span class="name">{{ participant.name }}</span>
        <button class="pin-btn" (click)="togglePin()">📌</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .premium-video-card {
      position: relative;
      border-radius: 16px;
      overflow: hidden;
      box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    }
    .overlay {
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 0;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
      background: linear-gradient(transparent, rgba(0,0,0,0.8));
      padding: 12px;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      align-items: center;
    }
  `]
})
export class MyCustomVideoCard {
  // Your custom implementation
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-custom-control-buttons',
  template: `
    <div class="modern-controls">
      <button class="control-btn mic" [class.active]="!isMuted" (click)="toggleMic()">
        <i class="icon-mic"></i>
      </button>
      <button class="control-btn camera" [class.active]="!isVideoOff" (click)="toggleVideo()">
        <i class="icon-camera"></i>
      </button>
      <button class="control-btn screen" (click)="toggleScreen()">
        <i class="icon-screen"></i>
      </button>
      <button class="control-btn leave danger" (click)="leaveMeeting()">
        <i class="icon-leave"></i>
      </button>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .modern-controls {
      display: flex;
      gap: 12px;
      padding: 16px;
      background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
      border-radius: 24px;
    }
    .control-btn {
      width: 48px;
      height: 48px;
      border-radius: 50%;
      border: none;
      cursor: pointer;
      transition: all 0.2s;
    }
    .control-btn.active {
      background: #4CAF50;
      color: white;
    }
    .control-btn.danger {
      background: #f44336;
      color: white;
    }
  `]
})
export class MyCustomControlButtons {
  // Your custom implementation
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-meeting-room',
  template: `
    <app-mediasfu-generic
      [credentials]="credentials"
      [uiOverrides]="customUIOverrides"
      [returnUI]="false">
    </app-mediasfu-generic>
  `
})
export class MeetingRoomComponent {
  credentials = { apiUserName: 'user', apiKey: 'key' };
  
  // Define your UI overrides
  customUIOverrides: Partial<MediasfuUICustomOverrides> = {
    // Replace video cards
    VideoCard: MyCustomVideoCard as Type<any>,
    
    // Replace control buttons
    ControlButtonsComponent: MyCustomControlButtons as Type<any>,
    
    // Replace modals
    ParticipantsModal: MyCustomParticipantsModal as Type<any>,
    
    // Replace other display components
    MainGrid: MyCustomMainGrid as Type<any>,
    FlexibleGrid: MyCustomFlexibleGrid as Type<any>,
    
    // ... any other components you want to replace
  };
}
```

### 4. Using WithOverrideDirective

The `*appWithOverride` directive enables conditional component replacement:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { WithOverrideDirective } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-conditional-override',
  imports: [WithOverrideDirective, /* other imports */],
  template: `
    <!-- Use default or custom component based on condition -->
    <app-video-card
      *appWithOverride="useCustomCard ? MyCustomVideoCard : null"
      [participant]="currentParticipant">
    </app-video-card>
    
    <!-- Override with custom component when premium feature enabled -->
    <app-control-buttons
      *appWithOverride="isPremiumUser ? PremiumControlButtons : null">
    </app-control-buttons>
  `
})
export class ConditionalOverrideComponent {
  useCustomCard = false;
  isPremiumUser = false;
  
  MyCustomVideoCard = MyCustomVideoCard;
  PremiumControlButtons = PremiumControlButtons;
}
```

### 5. Complete Example: Themed Meeting Room

Here's a comprehensive example combining all customization approaches:

```typescript
import { Component, TemplateRef, ViewChild, Type } from '@angular/core';
import { MediasfuUICustomOverrides } from 'mediasfu-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-themed-meeting-room',
  template: `
    <!-- Custom alert template -->
    <ng-template #brandedAlertTemplate let-message="message">
      <div class="branded-alert">
        <img src="/assets/logo.png" alt="Logo" class="alert-logo">
        <p>{{ message }}</p>
      </div>
    </ng-template>
    
    <app-mediasfu-conference
      [credentials]="credentials"
      [returnUI]="true"
      [uiOverrides]="themeOverrides"
      [containerStyle]="meetingContainerStyle">
      
      <!-- Customize individual components -->
      <app-main-grid
        [containerStyle]="gridStyle"
        [customTemplate]="customGridTemplate">
      </app-main-grid>
      
      <app-control-buttons-component
        [containerStyle]="controlsStyle">
      </app-control-buttons-component>
      
      <app-participants-modal
        [overlayStyle]="modalOverlayStyle"
        [contentStyle]="modalContentStyle">
      </app-participants-modal>
      
      <app-alert-component
        [customTemplate]="brandedAlertTemplate">
      </app-alert-component>
    </app-mediasfu-conference>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .branded-alert {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      gap: 12px;
      padding: 16px;
      background: white;
      border-left: 4px solid #007bff;
    }
  `]
})
export class ThemedMeetingRoomComponent {
  @ViewChild('brandedAlertTemplate') brandedAlertTemplate!: TemplateRef<any>;
  
  credentials = {
    apiUserName: 'your-api-username',
    apiKey: 'your-api-key'
  };
  
  // Container styling
  meetingContainerStyle: Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration> = {
    backgroundColor: '#0f0f0f',
    fontFamily: 'Inter, system-ui, sans-serif'
  };
  
  // Grid styling
  gridStyle: Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration> = {
    display: 'grid',
    gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))',
    gap: '16px',
    padding: '20px'
  };
  
  // Controls styling
  controlsStyle: Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration> = {
    position: 'fixed',
    bottom: '24px',
    left: '50%',
    transform: 'translateX(-50%)',
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)',
    borderRadius: '32px',
    padding: '12px 24px'
  };
  
  // Modal styling
  modalOverlayStyle: Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration> = {
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)',
    backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)'
  };
  
  modalContentStyle: Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration> = {
    backgroundColor: '#1a1a1a',
    color: '#ffffff',
    borderRadius: '16px',
    border: '1px solid #333'
  };
  
  // Component overrides
  themeOverrides: Partial<MediasfuUICustomOverrides> = {
    VideoCard: BrandedVideoCard as Type<any>,
    ControlButtonsComponent: ModernControls as Type<any>
  };
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Type Safety**: Always use `Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration>` for style properties
2. **Template Context**: Ensure your custom templates accept the correct context variables
3. **Component Lifecycle**: Custom replacement components should implement the same interface as the original
4. **Performance**: Avoid inline style objects in templates; define them in the component class
5. **Responsive Design**: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
6. **Accessibility**: Maintain ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation in custom components
7. **Testing**: Test custom components in isolation before integration

# API Reference

For detailed information on the API methods and usage, please refer to the [MediaSFU API Documentation](https://mediasfu.com/developers).

If you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask!

For sample codes and practical implementations, visit the [MediaSFU Sandbox](https://www.mediasfu.com/sandbox).

# Troubleshooting

1. **Optimizing HTML Configuration**:
   If users experience responsiveness issues, whether during local development or in production, they can optimize their HTML configuration to ensure proper scaling and viewport settings. By adding the following meta tag to the HTML `<head>` section, users can specify viewport settings for optimal display:
   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no" />
   ```

2. **Issues with Starting User Media (Audio/Video)**:
   If users encounter issues with starting user media (audio/video), they should try running in HTTPS mode. To enable HTTPS mode, users can modify their start script using:
   ```json
       ng serve --ssl true
   ```

3. **Handling Overflow in Prebuilt Components**:
    If users experience overflow issues when using any of the prebuilt MediaSFU components such as app-mediasfu-generic, app-mediasfu-broadcast, app-mediasfu-chat, etc., they can add a CSS rule in their main styles.css file to manage component dimensions and overflow behavior. For example, to handle overflow in the generic component, users can add:
  
    ```css
       app-mediasfu-generic {
          flex: 1;
          width: 100%;
          max-width: 100%;
          overflow: auto;
        }

        app-mediasfu-chat {
          flex: 1;
          width: 100%;
          max-width: 100%;
          overflow: auto;
        }

        // same for rest
      ```


4. **Interactive Testing with MediaSFU's Frontend**:
   Users can interactively join MediaSFU's frontend in the same room to analyze if various events or media transmissions are happening as expected. For example, adding a user there to check changes made by the host and vice versa.

These troubleshooting steps should help users address common issues and optimize their experience with MediaSFU. If the issues persist or additional assistance is needed, users can refer to the [documentation](https://mediasfu.com/docs) or reach out to the support team for further assistance.
